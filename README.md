Burgers-Handlebars

In this app, you're able to keep track of burgers that you want to eat, as well as burgers you've eaten!
When the aoo first loads, it gives you a list of any burgers you've already added to be tracked (each with a button to "devour" the burger), as well as gives you a button to add more. Should you click one of the buttons to devour a burger, that specific burger is then moved to a list of "devoured" burgers.
